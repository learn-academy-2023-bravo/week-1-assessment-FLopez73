# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: They are used to make decisions by using true or false depending on the values. 

Researched answer: Used to preform actions based on conditons that are set. These are also known as if/ else statements and there are three types of operators that can be used to create a conditionsl satatment those would be  equality operators (===), logical operators(&&,||,!), realtional operator (<,>,...). If conditon is met then the system executes the code of block that pertains to that specific condition.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:Not sure to be honest about git. Github is a hosting platform that allows you to store code and makes it eaiser to be able to collabarate remotely. 

Researched answer: Git is an open source version control system that tracks any changes that are made of a specific file and stores the repository and branches that had been edited form main file. The main diffrence between the is that github is a cloud based hosting site for git reposotiries while git is the actual version control system.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: Equality, logical and relational operators will return Boolean.

Researched answer: javascript operators are known as if/else statements or decisions trees that help compare to elements and decide the outcome on a true or false value.  There are equality operators that check if the two values are equal ex. ===(stricly equals). Logical operators are able to compare two evalutaions with symbols && (and), || (or), !(not). Relational operators are used for arithmetic evaluations and uses the signs >(greater than), <(less than), >=, <=. 

Used my class notes on this one. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is used to count the values in and array or a string. Index is the postition in which a value is located and the value is the physical data.

Researched answer:Index is a read only property that returns a value at the specific position. The difference is that the index helps identify the value in a string or an array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: a string is text that is defined by quoted while an array is a data type that uses rectangular brackets to hold sets of information. They both have bulilt in methos that can be used to manupulate them.

Researched answer: A string is a set of characters that are defined by '' while an array is a data structure that uses [] to store elements. They both are zero-index and the index can be used to identify elements in an arreay or characters in a string. An array can hold different data types while the string and only hold characters.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: In pair programing there is a driver and a navigator. The driver is the person that is doing the physical coding on the computer while the navigator is dicating directions at the diver on what to type in to vs code. 

Researched answer: Proper pair progamming requires a planning phase to determine what the problems are and what will be used to come to a desired outcome once planning is done then the tam can get into the dirver and navigator roles and execute the plan that was made. In order to be effective and fair to the team the driver and navigator should switch every 10-20 minutes. The role of the driver is to input the code into the computer while the navigator insctructs on ehat to type in communication is key for this to be effective.
